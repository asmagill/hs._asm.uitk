--- Returns a table of two positive integers, specifying the horizontal and vertical thickness of the turtle pen.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * a table specifying the horizontal and vertical thickness of the turtle pen.
---
--- Notes:
---  * in this implementation the two numbers will always be equal as the macOS uses a single width for determining stroke size.

---
--- Parameters:

---
--- Returns:

---
--- Notes:
---  * On most modern machines, font widths are variable for most fonts; as this is not easily calculated unless the specific text to be rendered is known, the height, as specified with [hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:setlabelheight](#setlabelheight) is returned for both values by this method.

--- Method
--- Moves the turtle to an absolute position in the graphics window. Does not change the turtle's heading.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `pos` - a table containing two numbers specifying the `x` and the `y` position within the turtle view to move the turtle to. (Note that this is *not* a point table with key-value pairs).
---
--- Returns:
---  * the turtleViewObject

--- hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:setxy(x, y) -> turtleViewObject
--- Method
--- Moves the turtle to an absolute position in the graphics window. Does not change the turtle's heading.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `x` - the x coordinate of the turtle's new position within the turtle view
---  * `y` - the y coordinate of the turtle's new position within the turtle view
---
--- Returns:
---  * the turtleViewObject

--- hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:setx(x) -> turtleViewObject
--- Method
--- Moves the turtle horizontally from its old position to a new absolute horizontal coordinate. Does not change the turtle's heading.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `x` - the x coordinate of the turtle's new position within the turtle view
---
--- Returns:
---  * the turtleViewObject

--- hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:sety(y) -> turtleViewObject
--- Method
--- Moves the turtle vertically from its old position to a new absolute vertical coordinate. Does not change the turtle's heading.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `y` - the y coordinate of the turtle's new position within the turtle view
---
--- Returns:
---  * the turtleViewObject

--- hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:setheading(angle) -> turtleViewObject
--- Method
--- Sets the heading of the turtle to a new absolute heading.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `angle` - The heading, in degrees clockwise from the positive Y axis, of the new turtle heading.
---
--- Returns:
---  * the turtleViewObject
---
--- Notes:
---  * Synonym: `hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:seth(angle)`

--- hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:home() -> turtleViewObject
--- Method
--- Moves the turtle to the center of the turtle view.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * the turtleViewObject
---
--- Notes:
---  * this is equivalent to `hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:setxy(0, 0):setheading(0)`.
---    * this does not change the pen state, so if the pen is currently down, a line may be drawn from the previous position to the home position.

--- hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:arc(angle, radius) -> turtleViewObject
--- Method
--- Draws an arc of a circle, with the turtle at the center, with the specified radius, starting at the turtleâ€™s heading and extending clockwise through the specified angle. The turtle does not move.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `angle` - the number of degrees the arc should extend from the turtle's current heading. Positive numbers indicate that the arc should extend in a clockwise direction, negative numbers extend in a counter-clockwise direction.
---  * `radius` - the distance from the turtle's current position that the arc should be drawn.
---
--- Returns:
---  * the turtleViewObject

--- Method
--- Displays a string at the turtleâ€™s position current position in the current pen mode and color.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `text` -
---
--- Returns:
---  * the turtleViewObject
---
--- Notes:
---  * does not move the turtle

--- hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:setlabelheight(height) -> turtleViewObject
--- Method
--- Sets the font size for text displayed with the [hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:label](#label) method.
---
--- Parameters:

---
--- Returns:
---  * the turtleViewObject

--- hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:setscrunch(xscale, yscale) -> turtleViewObject
--- Method
--- Adjusts the aspect ratio and scaling within the turtle view. Further turtle motion will be adjusted by multiplying the horizontal and vertical extent of the motion by the two numbers given as inputs.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `xscale` - a number specifying the horizontal scaling applied to the turtle position
---  * `yscale` - a number specifying the vertical scaling applied to the turtle position
---
--- Returns:
---  * the turtleViewObject
---
--- Notes:
---  * On old CRT monitors, it was common that pixels were not exactly square and this method could be used to compensate. Now it is more commonly used to create scaling effects.

--- hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:setpencolor(color) -> turtleViewObject
--- Method
--- Sets the pen color (the color the turtle draws when it moves and the pen is down).
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `color` - one of the following types:
---    * an integer greater than or equal to 0 specifying an entry in the color palette (see [hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:setpalette](#setpalette)). If the index is outside of the defined palette, defaults to black (index entry 0).

---  * the turtleViewObject
---
--- Notes:
---  * Synonym: `hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:setpc(color)`

--- hs._asm.uitk.element.turtle:setpalette(index, color) -> turtleViewObject
--- Method
--- Assigns the color to the palette at the given index.
